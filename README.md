## Project 1: Predicting Bike Sharing Data
In this project, I build and train my own Neural Network from scratch to predict the number of bike-share users on a given day.

## Project 2: Dog Breed Classifier (CNN)
In this project, I learned how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, my algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed.

## Project 3: Generate TV Scripts
Generate a TV script using a recurrent neural network.

## Project 4: Generate Faces
Two neural networks against each other to generate realistic faces.

## Project 5: Teach a Quadcopter How to Fly
I build a quadcopter flying agent that learns to take off, hover and land using reinforcement learning.
